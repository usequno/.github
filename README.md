# About Quno

Built for students, developers, and fintech enthusiasts, Quno provides an immersive environment to practice trading strategies without risk, while exploring machine learning forecasting techniques.

This open-source project is split into two core-parts:
- **quno_backend:** Handles real-time data ingestion, trade simulation logic, wallet management, and ML inference, all built in Rust for high performance.
- **quno_frontend:** Provides a responsive, interactive interface to visualize market data, execute trades, and display AI-driven predictions.
